# Maze
C++ console adventure game once created for school project

This is an adventure console game. The player creates a hero and then explores dungeons, fights enemies, and loots chambers to acquire treasures. 
The whole project is written in my native Polish language, but some longer descriptive texts are stored in a separate file, so translation isn't a major problem. 
The program was written in an object-oriented manner, and the .h and .cpp files were named appropriately for easier identification
