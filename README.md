# Maze
C++ console adventure game once created for school project

This is an adventure console game. The player creates a hero and then explores dungeons, fights enemies, and loots chambers to acquire treasures. 
The whole project is written in my native Polish language, but some longer descriptive texts are stored in a separate file, so translation isn't a major problem. 
The program was written in an object-oriented manner, and the .h and .cpp files were named appropriately for easier identification

About the game:
The game involves overcoming successive chambers of the labyrinth. At the beginning of the game, you create your own hero, who will then make his way through the labyrinth. The labyrinth consists of corridors and chambers, which alternate. In the corridors, there are forks where the player chooses the direction of travel. In the chambers, the player encounters opponents, finds treasures, and experiences various adventures. The player controls the hero by pressing selected numbers and confirming them with the enter key. The player will be asked to perform the above actions when it is necessary to make decisions. The hero has a certain number of health points. The game continues until they drop to zero. The hero has strength points, and during battles with opponents, the hero's strength is compared to the opponent's strength. The result of a dice roll is added to both values. To defeat an opponent, the result must be greater than or equal to the opponent's strength. Battles can be avoided by spending luck points. This allows the hero to avoid a fight and take the treasure. The player's final score is determined by the gold accumulated during the adventure.
